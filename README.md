## Readme File

Enclosed in this repository are projects of code for Magd 150.

## Example 1
[lab 006 example](https://github.com/veloffem12/MAGD-150-Assignments-Final/tree/gh-pages/s18magd150lab07_veloffe)
Example 1 is s18magd150lab006_veloffe
In this example I use an array to have many bubbles and flashing lights for a screen saver. I chose an agressive screen saver to wake up a college student when they fall asleep late at night working on an assignment. 

## Example 2
[lab 07 example](https://github.com/veloffem12/MAGD-150-Assignments-Final/tree/gh-pages/s18magd150lab07_veloffe)
Example 2 is s18magd150lab07_veloffe
In example 2 I use PVector to make it rain. My drawing is an example of rain on a sunny day. Using a different class for the doccument I was able to create 100 rain drops. 

## Example 3
[lab 01 example](https://github.com/veloffem12/MAGD-150-Assignments-Final/blob/gh-pages/s18magd150lab01_veloffe.pde)
Example 3 is s18magd150lab01_veloffe
In example 3 I learned how to use gray scale as well as how to draw different shapes. My drawing was trying to make a simple example of the solor system. 

## Example 4
[lab 02 example](https://github.com/veloffem12/MAGD-150-Assignments-Final/blob/gh-pages/s18magd150lab02_veloffe.pde)
Example 4 is s18magd150lab02
In example 4 I learned how to draw more complex shapes as well as how to use color scale. I made it look like different bloons were flying away in the sky. Their is a butter fly flying with the bloons. 

## Example 5
[lab 5 example](https://github.com/veloffem12/MAGD-150-Assignments-Final/blob/gh-pages/s18magd150lab5_veloffe.pde)
Example 5 is s18magd150lab5_veloffe
In example 5 is a game I made. The game was to pick a corner then that would create a portal. I used boolean as well as different ints and corlors. I used if and if else statements so the objects would hylight when you scrolled your mouse over them.
